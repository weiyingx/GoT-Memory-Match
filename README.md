**Introduction: What the project is about**

For unit 1, we were just introduced to HTML, CSS and Javascript. Hence, this project is to build a game to apply what we have learnt.

As a Game of Thrones fan-girl, I thought that it would be a good idea to create a game with that theme and what better way than to do it with a memory card game featuring our favourite characters.

####

This game uses the fisher-yates shuffle method to shuffle the cards.

A live version of the app has been deployed.
